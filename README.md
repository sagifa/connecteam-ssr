The home task was fun and good practice for me to enter the world of static rendering, but I found a few ways to achieve it - next js - image and fonts, and run the build on the server.

In addition, the design library I use Chakra-UI has a photo component for SSR
Since Nextjs isn't very good at handling SVGs, I tried to minimize this rendering with build components -> /components/icons/.
My favorite part of the JSON logic is how it fills up the page, I tried the app to be responsive to further JSONs with similar cunstructioni, i handle the JSON content with dynamic reusable components and styles, except for the footer section, as I didn't have the time to complete the task fully.

If you give me the chance, I would like to try my skills in responsive design.

In addition, I want to use the scroll button on hero section to collapse and un-collapse the other other sections and footers 



todos:
create color theme
form - build more effient JSON data 
section regular - add bg color to the banner on the image
hero - scroll button will collapse and uncollapse the other section
responsive on small screens
